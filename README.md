# JavaOOPMidtermExams
For midterm I in OOP

1. I faced challanges like writing incorrect URL with " ", I couldn't access the needed resources, but by writing https// and removing " " I was able to solve the issue and access the material.
   I also had challanges with structuring packages, but with usage of AI and writing correct pathes, I was finally able to solve this issue, connect files and make the programm work
2. AI tools like chatGPT, Claude and DeepSeek were vere useful, as they were quite helpful with analyzing individual questions and giving me exact answers I needed. AI was basically useful in each task for me, as it gave clear explanation what was wrong and why it was wrong with clear, even step-by-step explanation, just like with problem of incorrect URL or packages. Mostly AI helped me to understanding tasks, issues, approaches and solutions to the problem/
3. Of course, AI doesn't always give the desired result, as I often had asked wrong questions, hadn't given clearer explanation, included nuances and enough context so it would finally get me correctly. It made me waste a lot of timr, but also taught me to explain myself better, pay more attention to detail and understand the work on a more deep level.
